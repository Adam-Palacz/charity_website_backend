# charity_website_backend

A website that allows you to donate to charities, organizations and fundraising. Backend based on the Django framework for ready-made static website files (html, css and js). Using django, I created website views, forms handling, user and database management. The ability to automatically fill in the donation form summary and transfer data to the backend using the fetch option has been added to the js file.
